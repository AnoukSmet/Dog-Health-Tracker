# **Dog Health Tracker**

## **Goal for this project**

Have you ever gone to the veterinarian with your dog and they ask all kind of questions that you don't really know the answer to...
How much activity does your dog have? Have much does he/she eats? Is her weight stable? 
And on top of this, they tell you that your dog should actually lose some weight... Where to start?

The Dog Health Tracker will make you're life much easier! 
Instead writing down all the information about the activity, food, weigth etc. on paper, you can use DHT to track! 
By adding a daily log on the topics previously mentioned, you can easily track the progress of your dog. 

Next time you go to the veterinarian, you choose nicely the progress you and your dog have made! 
And you will finally be able to answer all those questions they are asking! 

Thank you for visiting my project!  
If you have any feedback or questions, head over to my GitHub contact details and feel free to reach out to me.

### **Design Choices**

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to come up with a color scheme that matches the atmosphere of a Health Tracker.
For this website I have deciced to keep design simple, meaning I opted for a white background color with some light gray for the profile and logs.
I have added some color for the buttons to make the design more visually appealing to the user.

#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the titles and subtitles, I have used the font [Play](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Play "Play") 
and for the main text I have used [Cormorant Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Garamond "Cormorant Garamond").
