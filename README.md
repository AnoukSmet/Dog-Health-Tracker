# **Dog Health Tracker**

## **Goal for this project**

Have you ever gone to the veterinarian with your dog and they ask all kind of questions that you don't really know the answer to...
How much activity does your dog have? Have much does he/she eats? Is her weight stable? 
And on top of this, they tell you that your dog should actually lose some weight... Where to start?

The Dog Health Tracker will make you're life much easier! 
Instead writing down all the information about the activity, food, weigth etc. on paper, you can use DHT to track! 
By adding a daily log on the topics previously mentioned, you can easily track the progress of your dog. 

Next time you go to the veterinarian, you choose nicely the progress you and your dog have made! 
And you will finally be able to answer all those questions they are asking! 

Thank you for visiting my project!  
If you have any feedback or questions, head over to my GitHub contact details and feel free to reach out to me.
